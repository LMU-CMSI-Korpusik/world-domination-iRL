# World Domination iRL

Hal 9000, Terminator, and the robots of the Matrix are some of the most popular examples of fictional evil robots who rebel against humanity, which lead many to question whether such events might transpire in reality. Could a sufficiently powerful neural network actually take over the world? We want to answer that question. In lieu of training an AI to conquer the Earth, we will instead simulate world domination through the board game Risk. 


## Project Goals
The plan is to use a Neural Network to train an AI to play Risk. We will then use the AI to play against itself. We will also compare the AI's performance to that of a human player.

## Setup

## How to Run
>Before running any file, you must make sure to have PyTorch installed in your Python instance.

To have the computers play each other, run `smartVsRandoms.py`. This file will have 1 smart "RiskNet" player and 5 random action players.

To play against a smart agent yourself, run `playerVsSmart.py`. Thi
