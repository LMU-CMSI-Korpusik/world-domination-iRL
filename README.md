# World Domination iRL (in Reinforcement Learning)


## Introduction
Hal 9000, Terminator, and the robots of the Matrix are some of the most popular examples of fictional evil robots who rebel against humanity, which lead many to question whether such events might transpire in reality. Could a sufficiently powerful neural network actually take over the world? We want to answer that question. In lieu of training an AI to conquer the Earth, we will instead simulate world domination through the board game Risk. We will implement a neural network that will use reinforcement learning to learn how to play Risk.
